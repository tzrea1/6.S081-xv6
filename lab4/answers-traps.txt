1. Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?

  a1、a2
  a2

2. Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)

2.1  no call f()(and no call g())
     make inline optimization that a1 = 12
2.2  the compiler inline func (look at line:32)
   26 int f(int x) {
   27    e:   1141                    addi    sp,sp,-16
   28   10:   e422                    sd  s0,8(sp)
   29   12:   0800                    addi    s0,sp,16
   30   return g(x);
   31 }
   32   14:   250d                    addiw   a0,a0,3
   33   16:   6422                    ld  s0,8(sp)
   34   18:   0141                    addi    sp,sp,16
   35   1a:   8082                    ret

3. At what address is the function printf located?
   0x30+1536=0x630

4. What value is in the register 'ra' just after the 'jalr' to 'printf' in 'main'?
   ra = pc+4 = 0x34 + 0x4 = 0x38

5. Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);

What is the output? Here's an ASCII table that maps bytes to characters.
The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?

5.1
I run this process in win10, because ubuntu has warning(win10 also use little endian and I make some changes)

#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s \n", 57616, &i);
    printf("H%x Wo%x \n", 57616, i);
}

output:
He110 World
He110 Wo646c72

5.2
in ASCII: 0x72->r, 0x6c->l, 0x64->d
if RISC-V is big endian, we must change i (i = 0x00646c72 => i = 0x00726c64)
because we would the value of fisrt addr is 0x72 in big endian

No change 57616
because we only use it hexadecimal value

6.In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);

I also run this process in win10 and I also make some changes

#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
    printf("x=%d y=%d \n");
    printf("x=%d y=%d \n", 3);
}

output:
x=11364944 y=11356192
x=3 y=434198848

before run this process,
x belong to a register that value is 11364944
y belong to another register that value is 434198848

before run this process,
x belong to a register that value be changed to 3
y belong to another register that value also is 434198848
